        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
        Hi there! My name is Benedek Balla, I am a fourth year undergraduate student at the University of Toronto studying computer science
        with a minor in statistics. I am absolutely fasctinated by machine learning, and have an intense desire to contribute original research to the field!
        In 2025, I hope to start my graduate studies in computer science, and then pursue a career in industry where I aspire to work with experienced and enthustic people, 
        in order to creatively and synergistically solve problems and learn as much as I can in the process! By the way, before I forget, thanks Gemini for the profile picture! :)

      <h2 class="pastel-text">Ongoing and Past Projects</h2>
          <h3>Accelerating ML Algorithms with Nvidia GPUs</h3>
          <h4>Status : ONGOING (May 2024 - Present) </h4>
            <p class="pastel-text">
            At the time of writing (June 9th 2024 - having spending the whole day studying CUTLASS GEMM), I am 1 month into this project and I am absolutely loving it. Over the past weeks, I have learned 
            about Nvidia's Volta, Ampere, and Hopper GPU architectures, how these architectures work in tandem with the CUDA programming model,
            and how PyTorch's TorchDynamo and TorchInductor utilize OpenAI's Triton to automatically optimize high-level ML code to run on GPUs 
            via a set of hard-coded compiler passes. 
            </p>

          <h3>DDPMs for Synthetic MSK-US Image Generation</h3>
          <h4>Status : "DONE?" (September 2023 - Present) </h4>
            <p class="pastel-text">
            Publishing a research paper where I compare augmentation and diffusion-based image synthesis for enriching MSK-US datasets. 
            </p>
